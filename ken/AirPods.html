              percent lower gaming latency.<sup>5</sup> So whether you’re
              playing games, listening to music, or enjoying podcasts, you’ll

              AirPods deliver an industry-leading <sup>6</sup> 5 hours of
              listening time<sup>7</sup> — and now up to 3 hours of talk
              time<sup>8</sup> — all on one charge. And they’re made to keep up
              with you, thanks to a charging case that holds multiple charges
              for more than 24 hours of listening time.<sup>9</sup> Need a quick
              charge? Just put AirPods back in the case for 15 minutes to get up
              to 3 hours of listening time<sup>10</sup> or up to 2 hours of talk
              time.<sup>11</sup> To check the battery, hold the AirPods next to
              your iPhone or ask Siri “How’s the battery on my AirPods?” And
              when your AirPods need charging, a notification conveniently
              appears on your iPhone.
